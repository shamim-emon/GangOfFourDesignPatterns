## 📚 What Are GoF Design Patterns?

The **Gang of Four (GoF)** refers to the authors of the influential book *"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"*.  
They categorized **23 design patterns** into three groups:
- **Creational Patterns**
- **Structural Patterns**
- **Behavioral Patterns**

These patterns provide general solutions to common software design problems and help create flexible, reusable, and maintainable code.
